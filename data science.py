Some of the popular languages used in Data Science are:
- Python
- R
- SQL
- Julia
- Java
- Scala
## Data Science Libraries
Popular libraries used in Data Science include:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- PyTorch
## Data Science Tools
| Tool          | Description                                  |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Jupyter       | Interactive computing environment           |
| RStudio       | Integrated development environment for R    |
| Apache Spark  | Cluster-computing framework                 |
| TensorFlow    | Machine learning framework                  |

## Arithmetic Expression Examples
Below are examples of arithmetic operations like addition and multiplication.
# Multiplication and addition
a = 5
b = 4
multiply = a * b
add = a + b
multiply, add
# Convert minutes to hours
minutes = 150
hours = minutes / 60
hours
## Objectives
The objectives of this notebook are:
- To demonstrate the use of markdown cells.
- To list common data science languages and libraries.
- To showcase arithmetic operations using code cells.
- To convert time units using code cells.
- To create a table of commonly used data science tools.
